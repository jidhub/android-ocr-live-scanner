Only recognize letters "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789<" appearing in Machine Readable Zone of Passports and other IDs.

Runs the Tesseract OCR engine using [tess-two](https://github.com/rmtheis/tess-two), a fork of Tesseract Tools for Android, with or without Cube.

https://github.com/rmtheis has adapted most of the code making up the core structure of this project from the ZXing Barcode Scanner. Along with Tesseract-OCR and Tesseract Tools for Android (tesseract-android-tools), several open source projects have been used in this project, including leptonica, google-api-translate-java, microsoft-translator-java-api, and jtar.
